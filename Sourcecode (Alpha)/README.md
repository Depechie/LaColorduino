# Note
Please read the Wiki here on GitHub before your starting bullshittering around :D

**You still need to download the other lib, too. Read the Wiki here on Github!**

NOTE!!!! IT'S IN ALPHA. I'LL UNCOMMENT USELESS THINGS AND MAKE THIS CODE MORE
READABLY. PLEASE DON'T SEND ANY BUG REPORTS UNTIL IT REACH BETA.
IT'S JUST A DEMO AT THE MOMENT AND I'LL UPDATE THE WIKI. 
IF YOU ARE INTRESTED TO TEST IT, DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE:
API_KEY               // Google apps API Token
CHANNEL_ID            // Url of channel
*ow_key               // Openweather API Token
owCC.updateConditions(ow_cond, ow_key, "gb", "London", Setting.Global_Unit);
Setting.Global_Unit   // Celsius = 5, Fahrenheit = 6, Kelvin = 7
ssid[]                // your network SSID (name)
password[]            // your network key
YOU SEE, IT SHOULD BE UNIFIEDE AT THE TOP OF ONE SOURCECODE.
NOT ALL WATCHFACES WORKS LIKE INTENDED LIKE THE YOUTUBE WATCHFACES.
IT CAN'T HANDLE VERY BIG NUMBERS AND IM STILL WORKING TO SOLVE THIS.

COMPILING:
A_ESP8266            ->  Arduino IDE 1.8.6
A_LaColorduino       ->  Arduino IDE 1.6.0
A_LaColorduino_Icon  ->  Arduino IDE 1.6.0
B_Calibration        ->  Arduino IDE 1.6.0

YEAH NOT THE BEST SOLUTION, BUT I'M WORKING ON IT!
