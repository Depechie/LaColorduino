**[Click me for a short video demo (OLD)](https://twitter.com/TheAmadeus25/status/1095430617074937860)**

**[Sneak-Peak with comment in GER and ENG](http://bit.ly/UWGSmartwatch1)**

I build my own clone of LaMetric smartwatch but with 5 Colorduino. It will make use of an ESP8266 NodeMCU for the connection to the Internet. It's build for everdays use like showing your subscribers on YouTube, follower on Twitter, clicks on Twitch or the weather at the moment. There is (in the future) everthing for everbody and everthing is selfmade! Maybe we can create something very big for the world?

‚ùî Interested? Well, read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/wiki)*** and you will get Happy, yay.

üò• However, the Wiki isn't completed, yet.

# Preview of Watchfaces

## Clock
It shows the current time downloaded from a NTP-Server. Currently, it shows the time in 24h. In the future I add AM/PM mode as well. Dark-Mode is supported which mean, it lower the light to the lowest value possible. It's very handy in the night, because the icon isn't appering in dark-mode. Icon isn't animated and doesn't show the current time. Maybe I update this.

## Indoor
Based on the BME280 sensor, it give you some information like temperature, humidity and air-pressure.

**Temperature**

It show the current temperature in Celsius (¬∞C), Fahrenheit (¬∞F) and Kelvin (K). The logo is animated. Depending on the current temperature it change it's color and the level indicator:
* Ice-Blue
* Blue
* Green
* Yellow
* Red

**Indoor Humidity**

There is a watchface just for the current humidity.

## YouTube

The ESP8266 get its information directly from YouTube it's self. Sometimes, it doesn't show any value after startup but I'm working on it.

**Subscriber**

This watchface shows how many people are subscribed to your YouTube channel.

**View**

It also shows you how many total views you have already. Currently, non of my counters support numbers higher than 99.999.999. I'll change this later to something more readable like 99.99M.

**Comment**

This one is confusing me. The official API says something about current/new comments, but that's not true. Maybe they mean new Inbox messages but I can't test this; I never get any messages üò•üòã

**Video**

Did you know, how many videos are currently public (not uploaded)? Well now you know it.

## Twitch

Now, you reach the more important part of this Smartwatch. It gets its information directly from Twitch, same like YouTube before.

**Follower**

This counter shows you, how many people are subscribed to your Twitch channel.

![Preview Twitch Follower](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Twitch/IMG_0731.JPG?raw=true)

**View**

This watchface tells you how many views you have in total.

## Twitter

**Follower**

## Software/Converter to program them
* Arduino [**1.6.0**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous) (Colorduino doesn't work properly on 1.8.6. It shows wrong color so you need to download an older version, aswell)
* Arduino 1.8.6 for ESP8266 (funny he?)
* [USB to TTL-Converter with CP2102](https://www.amazon.de/SODIAL-USB-TTL-Konverter-Modul-eingebautem-CP2102/dp/B008RF73CS/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1534713779&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=cp2102+breakout) (or similar)
* (Library incoming)
* Help of the community
  * Testing
  * Bug fixing

## Additional to the software, it requires some hardware

* 5x Colorduino Matrix 8x8 RGB LED Full Dot/Square (Feel free to mixed them up)
  * 1st shows the symbol/logo, everything else shows the information
* LDR (if it's dark, watchface change to clock with lowest light so you can sleep at night without any glare)
* 3x Button (not planed to use all of them at the moment)
* BME280 for indoor use
* ADS1115 or similar for those Buttons and LDR. (Yeah, 15-bit resolution is an overkill üòÑ)
* 5V-3.3V Level Shifter (if I use an ESP8266-01)
* DC-DC 12V to 5V and 3.3V Step-down Power Supply
  * We need at least 3.3V/5V for ESP8266 and 6.5V to 7.5V for RGB Matrix, at least 1A+.
