# LaColorduino
## Your own Smartwatch with Internet connection
I build my own clone of LaMetric smartwatch but with 5 Colorduino.
It will make use of an ESP8266 (01 or NodeMCU) for connection to the Internet.
I plan to add things like:
1. Twitch
1

2. YouTube stats
3. Weather Information
4. Indoor temperature/humidity/barometric
5.
