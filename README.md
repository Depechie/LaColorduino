**[Click me for a short video demo (OLD)](https://twitter.com/TheAmadeus25/status/1095430617074937860)**

**[Sneak-Peak with comment in GER and ENG](http://bit.ly/UWGSmartwatch1)**

I build my own clone of LaMetric smartwatch but with 5 Colorduino. It will make use of an ESP8266 NodeMCU for the connection to the Internet. It's build for everyday use like showing your subscribers on **[YouTube](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#youtube)**, follower on **[Twitter](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#twitter)**, clicks on **[Twitch](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#twitch)** or the **[Weather](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#weather)** at the moment. Even live-stats of **[CounterStrike: Global Offensive](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#counterstrike-global-offensive)** it's supported! What do you want more? Wait, don't say it loud, it also has a **[dark-mode](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#clock-dark-mode)**. In the future, there is  everything for everybody and everything is self-made! Maybe we can create something very big for the world?

‚ùî Interested? Well, read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/wiki)** and you will get Happy, yay.

üò• However, the Wiki isn't completed, yet. That's a hole bunch of work and I change almost everytime something about this project.

# Preview of Watchfaces

## Clock
It shows the current time downloaded from a NTP-Server every few seconds. I'll try to use the clock-cycle to lower the count of requests. Currently, it shows the time in 24h. In the future I add AM/PM mode as well. Icon isn't animated and doesn't show the current time. Maybe I update this.

### Clock (day)

![Preview Clock Day](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Clock/IMG_0705.JPG?raw=true)

### Clock (dark-mode)
**Dark-Mode** is supported which mean, it lower the light to the lowest value possible. It's very handy in the night, because the icon isn't appering in dark-mode.

******
## Indoor
Based on the **BME280** sensor, it give you some information like **temperature**, **humidity** and **air-pressure**.

### Temperature

It show the current temperature in **Celsius** _(¬∞C)_, **Fahrenheit** _(¬∞F)_ and **Kelvin** _(K)_. The logo is animated. Depending on the current temperature it change it's color and the level indicator:
* Ice-Blue _(Current not in use)_
* Blue _(T < 22¬∞C)_
* Green _(22¬∞C ‚â§ T < 25¬∞C)_
* Yellow _(25¬∞C ‚â§ T < 30¬∞C)_
* Red _(30¬∞C ‚â§ T)_

![Preview Indoor Temperature 2](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Indoor/IMG_0839.jpg?raw=true)

### Indoor Humidity

There is a watchface just for the current **humidity**.

******
## Weather

Based on **[openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/)** it show the current **weather** at your location. It change the icon as well, depending on the weather.

### Clear Sky (day)

**[...more photos incoming](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)**

******
## YouTube

The ESP8266 get its information directly from **YouTube** it's self. Sometimes, it doesn't show any value after startup but I'm working on it. **[Library from witnessmenow aka Brian Lough found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino-youtube-api)**.

### Subscriber

This watchface shows how many people are **subscribed** to your YouTube channel.

![Preview YouTube Subscriber](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/YouTube/IMG_0730.JPG?raw=true)

### View

It also shows you how many **total views** you have already. Currently, non of my counters support numbers higher than 99.999.999. I'll change this later to something more readable like 99.99M.

![Preview YouTube View](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/YouTube/IMG_0738.JPG?raw=true)

### Comment

This one is confusing me. The **[official API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/?apix=true)** says something about current/new comments, but that's not true. Maybe they mean new Inbox messages but I can't test this; I never get any messages üò•üòã

![Preview YouTube Comment](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/YouTube/IMG_0739.jpg?raw=true)

### Video

Did you know, how many videos are currently public (not uploaded)? Well, now you know it.

******
## Twitch

Now, you reach the more important part of this Smartwatch. It gets its information directly from **Twitch**, same like YouTube before. In the future I try to add a Watchface which shows if you are currently online/streaming. I'm pretty sure, it looks great on camera while streaming! **[Library from witnessmenow aka Brian Lough found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino_twitch_api)**.

### Follower

This counter shows you, how many people are **subscribed** to your Twitch channel.

![Preview Twitch Follower](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Twitch/IMG_0731.JPG?raw=true)

### View

This watchface tells you how many **views** you have in total.

## Twitter

Socialmedia gets more important these days. So how about a watchface as well? It works same like Twitch and YouTube before. **[Library from witnessmenow aka Brian Lough found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino-twitter-api)**

### Follower

How many people are **following** you.

### Tweets

You are tweeting more like birds in the morning? What is this in numbers?? This one will help you.

### Last Tweet Retweet

How often got your **last tweet retweeted**.

## CounterStrike: Global Offensive 

Yes my friend, it's true! It can show you your **current stats** as well! I just modified the **[official API from Valve](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration)** a little. It shows you:
* Kill
* Assist
* Death
* Health _(as progressbar)(working on it)_
* Who wins _(CT or T)_
* Bomb state _(defused or exploded)(it override who win)_

TBH, this watchface has a lot of problems and need additional **[script](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio/tree/master/Sourcecode)** and **[software](https://nodejs.org/de/download/)** which I also uploaded **[here](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio)**. Just follow the **[wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio/wiki)**. Currently, it's not free of bugs and sometimes it just crashed the hole microcontroller. However, I'm working on it. At the moment, I'm just wondering about its input-lag. In my **[other project](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-Ambilight-System)** it acts in less then 6ms over WiFi! Maybe I need to optimize my Smartwatch at the first place, before I start digging around.

### Livestats

You can change the delimiter of this watchface into one of the following char:
* space
* slash
* dot
* vertical line
* colon
* hyphen
* asterix
