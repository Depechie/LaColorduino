# LaColorduino - Your own Smartwatch how it should be (it's a clone)
I build my own clone of LaMetric smartwatch but with 5 Colorduino.
It will make use of an ESP8266 (01 or NodeMCU) for connection to the Internet.

  * [ ] Humidity
  * [ ] Barometric
* [ ] Webinterface
* [ ] Update over-the-air (ESP8266 only)
* [ ] Calendar
* [ ] Clock (of course ðŸ˜„)
## Software/Converter to program them
* Arduino [**1.6.0**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous) (Colorduino doesn't work properly on 1.8.6. It shows wrong color)
* [USB to TTL-Converter with CP2102](https://www.amazon.de/SODIAL-USB-TTL-Konverter-Modul-eingebautem-CP2102/dp/B008RF73CS/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1534713779&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=cp2102+breakout) (or similar)

## Additional to the software, it requires some hardware
* 5x Colorduino Matrix Shield (it's possible up to 254 but never testing)
* 5x Colorduino Matrix 8x8 RGB LED Full Dot/Square (Feel free to mixed them up)
  * 1st shows the symbol/logo, everything else shows the information
* LDR (if it's dark, watchface change to clock with lowest light so you can sleep at night)
* 3x Button (not planed to use all of them at the moment)
* BME280 for indoor use
* ADS1115 (Analog-Digital-Converter) or similar
* 5V-3.3V Level Shifter (if I use an ESP8266-01)
* DC-DC 12V to 5V and 3.3V Step-down Power Supply
  * We need at least 3.3V/5V for ESP8266 and 6.5V to 7.5V for RGB Matrix, at least 1A+.
* Messing Spacer (for mounting)
