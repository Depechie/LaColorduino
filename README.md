[Sneak-Peak with comment in GER and ENG](http://bit.ly/UWGSmartwatch1)

I build my own clone of LaMetric smartwatch but with 5 Colorduino. It will make use of an ESP8266 NodeMCU for the connection to the Internet. It's build for everdays use like showing your subscribers on YouTube, follower on Twitter, clicks on Twitch or the weather at the moment. There is (in the future) everthing for everbody and everthing is selfmade! Maybe we can create something very big for the world?

‚ùî Interested? Well, read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/wiki)*** and you will get Happy, yay.

üò• However, the Wiki isn't completed, yet.

## Software/Converter to program them
* Arduino [**1.6.0**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous) (Colorduino doesn't work properly on 1.8.6. It shows wrong color so you need to download an older version, aswell)
* Arduino 1.8.6 for ESP8266 (funny he?)
* [USB to TTL-Converter with CP2102](https://www.amazon.de/SODIAL-USB-TTL-Konverter-Modul-eingebautem-CP2102/dp/B008RF73CS/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1534713779&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=cp2102+breakout) (or similar)
* (Library incoming)
* Help of the community
  * Testing
  * Bug fixing
  * Optimize
  * Adding feature

## Additional to the software, it requires some hardware
* 5x Colorduino Matrix Shield (it's possible up to 254 but never testing)
* 5x Colorduino Matrix 8x8 RGB LED Full Dot/Square (Feel free to mixed them up)
  * 1st shows the symbol/logo, everything else shows the information
* LDR (if it's dark, watchface change to clock with lowest light so you can sleep at night without any glare)
* 3x Button (not planed to use all of them at the moment)
* BME280 for indoor use
* ADS1115 or similar for those Buttons and LDR. (Yeah, 15-bit resolution is an overkill üòÑ)
* 5V-3.3V Level Shifter (if I use an ESP8266-01)
* DC-DC 12V to 5V and 3.3V Step-down Power Supply
  * We need at least 3.3V/5V for ESP8266 and 6.5V to 7.5V for RGB Matrix, at least 1A+.
* Messing Spacer (for mounting)
